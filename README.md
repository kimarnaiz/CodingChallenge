Challenge 3: Building REST API

The application is capable of the following:
1. List/add/update/delete Sellers
2. List/add/update/delete Products per Seller

I used Mongoose (for the server), Mongo DB for the backend service, utilized Mongo DB Compasee (to easily connect with the created collections in Mongo DB) and postman to send POST/GET requests to the created database.
I followed an online tutorial in Udemy to be able to try building the REST APIs.
